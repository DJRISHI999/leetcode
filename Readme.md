## Problems and Solutions

### 1. Find Missing Number in Array
- **Problem**:  
  You are given an array of size `n` containing numbers from `0` to `n`, but one number is missing. The task is to find the missing number efficiently.  
  For example, if the input array is `[3, 0, 1]`, the missing number is `2`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Instead of iterating through the array multiple times, we use the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers:  
  \[
  \text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
  \]  
  Calculate the total sum using this formula and subtract the sum of the array elements from it. This gives the missing number in \(O(n)\) time with \(O(1)\) space.

### 2. Check if a Number is a Power of Two
- **Problem**:  
  Determine if a given number is a power of two. A number is a power of two if it can be expressed as \(2^k\), where \(k \geq 0\). For example:
  - \(4\) is a power of two (\(2^2\)).
  - \(6\) is not a power of two.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use a bitwise operation to check if the number has only one bit set in its binary representation. The condition \(n > 0 \, \& \, (n \& (n - 1)) == 0\) works because:
  - \(n \& (n - 1)\) clears the rightmost set bit.
  - If the result is \(0\), the number is a power of two.

### 3. Find Two Distinct Numbers in an Array
- **Problem**:  
  Given an array where every element appears twice except for two distinct elements, find those two elements. For example:
  - Input: `[2, 4, 7, 9, 2, 4]`
  - Output: `[7, 9]`

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  - XOR all elements in the array. The result will be the XOR of the two distinct numbers.
  - Find the rightmost set bit in the XOR result. This bit differentiates the two numbers.
  - Divide the numbers into two groups based on this bit and XOR the numbers in each group to isolate the two distinct numbers.

### 4. Maximum Subarray
- **Problem**:  
  Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in a given array. For example:
  - Input: `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`
  - Output: `6` (subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]`).

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use Kadane's Algorithm:
  - Maintain a running sum and reset it to \(0\) if it becomes negative.
  - Track the maximum sum encountered during the iteration.
  This approach runs in \(O(n)\) time with \(O(1)\) space.

### 5. Product of Array Except Self
- **Problem**:  
  Given an array, return an array where each element is the product of all elements except itself. For example:
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Output: `[24, 12, 8, 6]`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  - Use two arrays to store the prefix and suffix products.
  - Multiply the prefix and suffix products for each element to get the result.
  This approach avoids division and runs in \(O(n)\) time with \(O(n)\) space.

### 6. Container with Most Water
- **Problem**:  
  Given an array of heights, find the maximum area of water that can be contained between two lines. For example:
  - Input: `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
  - Output: `49`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use a two-pointer approach:
  - Start with the left and right pointers at the ends of the array.
  - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward to maximize the area.
  This approach runs in \(O(n)\) time.

### 7. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- **Problem**:  
  Search for a target in a rotated sorted array. For example:
  - Input: `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, Target: `0`
  - Output: `4`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use a modified binary search:
  - Determine which half of the array is sorted.
  - Narrow the search to the sorted half if the target lies within its range.
  This approach runs in \(O(\log n)\) time.

- **[Solution File](Search_in_Rotated_sorted_array.java)**

---

### 8. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- **Problem**:  
  Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array. For example:
  - Input: `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`
  - Output: `1`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use binary search:
  - Compare the middle element with the rightmost element to determine which half contains the minimum.
  This approach runs in \(O(\log n)\) time.

- **[Solution File](Find_Minimum_in_Rotated_Sorted_Array.java)**

---

### 9. Maximum Product Subarray
- **Problem**:  
  Find the contiguous subarray with the largest product. For example:
  - Input: `[2, 3, -2, 4]`
  - Output: `6`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Track both the maximum and minimum product at each step because a negative number can turn the smallest product into the largest. Update the result with the maximum product encountered. This approach runs in \(O(n)\) time.

- **[Solution File](Max_product_subarray.java)**

---

### 10. Check for Duplicates in Array
- **Problem**:  
  Check if an array contains duplicates within a given range. For example:
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, \(k = 3\)
  - Output: `true`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use a HashMap to store the indices of elements. Check if the difference between indices of duplicate elements is within the given range. This approach runs in \(O(n)\) time.

- **[Solution File](Contain_duplicate_II.java)**

---

### 11. Generate Secure Code
- **Problem**:  
  Calculate the absolute difference between the sum of primes and non-primes in a range. For example:
  - Input: \(m = 1, n = 10\)
  - Output: `17`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently find all primes in the range. Iterate through the range to calculate the sums of primes and non-primes. This approach runs in \(O(n \log \log n)\) time.
