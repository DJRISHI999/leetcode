## Problems and Solutions

### 1. Find Missing Number in Array
- **Problem**:  
  You are given an array of size `n` containing numbers from `0` to `n`, but one number is missing. The task is to find the missing number efficiently.  
  For example, if the input array is `[3, 0, 1]`, the missing number is `2`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers:  
  `Sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2`  
  Subtract the sum of the array elements from the total sum to find the missing number in `O(n)` time with `O(1)` space.

### 2. Check if a Number is a Power of Two
- **Problem**:  
  Determine if a given number is a power of two. A number is a power of two if it can be expressed as `2^k`, where `k >= 0`. For example:
  - `4` is a power of two (`2^2`).
  - `6` is not a power of two.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use a bitwise operation to check if the number has only one bit set in its binary representation. The condition `n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0` works because:
  - `n & (n - 1)` clears the rightmost set bit.
  - If the result is `0`, the number is a power of two.

### 3. Find Two Distinct Numbers in an Array
- **Problem**:  
  Given an array where every element appears twice except for two distinct elements, find those two elements. For example:
  - Input: `[2, 4, 7, 9, 2, 4]`
  - Output: `[7, 9]`

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  - XOR all elements in the array. The result will be the XOR of the two distinct numbers.
  - Find the rightmost set bit in the XOR result. This bit differentiates the two numbers.
  - Divide the numbers into two groups based on this bit and XOR the numbers in each group to isolate the two distinct numbers.

### 4. Maximum Subarray
- **Problem**:  
  Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in a given array. For example:
  - Input: `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`
  - Output: `6` (subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]`).

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use Kadane's Algorithm:
  - Maintain a running sum and reset it to `0` if it becomes negative.
  - Track the maximum sum encountered during the iteration.
  This approach runs in `O(n)` time with `O(1)` space.

### 5. Product of Array Except Self
- **Problem**:  
  Given an array, return an array where each element is the product of all elements except itself. For example:
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Output: `[24, 12, 8, 6]`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  - Use two arrays to store the prefix and suffix products.
  - Multiply the prefix and suffix products for each element to get the result.
  This approach avoids division and runs in `O(n)` time with `O(n)` space.

### 6. Container with Most Water
- **Problem**:  
  Given an array of heights, find the maximum area of water that can be contained between two lines. For example:
  - Input: `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
  - Output: `49`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use a two-pointer approach:
  - Start with the left and right pointers at the ends of the array.
  - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward to maximize the area.
  This approach runs in `O(n)` time.

- **[Solution File](Container_with_most_water.java)**

### 7. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- **Problem**:  
  Search for a target in a rotated sorted array. For example:
  - Input: `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, Target: `0`
  - Output: `4`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use a modified binary search:
  - Determine which half of the array is sorted.
  - Narrow the search to the sorted half if the target lies within its range.
  This approach runs in `O(log n)` time.

- **[Solution File](Search_in_Rotated_sorted_array.java)**

### 8. Generate Secure Code
- **Problem**:  
  Calculate the absolute difference between the sum of primes and non-primes in a range. For example:
  - Input: `m = 1, n = 10`
  - Output: `17`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently find all primes in the range. Iterate through the range to calculate the sums of primes and non-primes. This approach runs in `O(n log log n)` time.

### 9. XOR from 0 to N
- **Problem**:  
  Calculate the XOR of all numbers from `0` to `N`.  
  For example:
  - Input: `5`
  - Output: `1`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use the pattern:
  - `n % 4 == 0`: XOR is `n`.
  - `n % 4 == 1`: XOR is `1`.
  - `n % 4 == 2`: XOR is `n + 1`.
  - `n % 4 == 3`: XOR is `0`.

### 10. Alien Dictionary
- **Problem**:  
  Check if words are sorted according to a custom alphabet order.  
  For example:
  - Input: `["hello", "leetcode"]`, Order: `"hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"`
  - Output: `true`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Map each character to its position in the custom order. Compare adjacent words character by character to ensure they are in the correct order.

### 11. Print Numbers from 1 to 100 Without Loops
- **Problem**:  
  Print numbers from `1` to `100` without using loops.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use recursion to print numbers incrementally.

### 12. Remove Duplicates in Sorted Array
- **Problem**:  
  Remove duplicates from a sorted array.  
  For example:
  - Input: `[1, 1, 2]`
  - Output: `[1, 2]`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use two pointers:
  - One pointer iterates through the array.
  - The other pointer tracks the position of unique elements.

- **[Solution File](Remove_duplicate_in_Sorted_Array.java)**

---

### 13. Diamond Pattern
- **Problem**:  
  Print a diamond pattern of stars.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use nested loops:
  - The outer loop controls the rows.
  - The inner loops print spaces and stars for each row.

- **[Solution File](diamond.c)**

### 14. Number Pattern
- **Problem**:  
  Print a specific number pattern based on input.  
  For example:
  - Input: `3`
  - Output:  
    ```
    33333
    32223
    32123
    32223
    33333
    ```

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use nested loops to generate the pattern:
  - The outer loop controls the rows.
  - The inner loops print decreasing and increasing numbers.

- **[Solution File](number_pattern.c)**

### 15. Calculate with Base
- **Problem**:  
  Convert the sum of two numbers to a given base.  
  For example:
  - Input: `num1 = 5, num2 = 7, base = 2`
  - Output: `1100`.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  Use division and modulus to convert the sum to the desired base.

### 16. Unset Set Bits
- **Problem**:  
  Find all unset bits in a number.

- **Optimized Approach**:
